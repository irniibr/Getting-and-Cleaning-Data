#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains README.md, run_analysis.R, CodeBook.md and tidydata.txt used and created to complete the project for getting and cleaning data course.

##Files

1. run_analysis.R contains the R script that does the following:
  - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set,
  - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, 
  - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set,
  - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names, and 
  - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2. CodeBook.md describes:
  - Variables, 
  - Data, and 
  - Any transformations or work that has been performed to clean up the data.

3. tidydata.txt is the output of the analysis done.
